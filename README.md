What this project was intended to do was to allow a train administrator to
submit train info into a field, and have it appear in a table, along with
telling how long until the next train would come.

Getting all of the data to send to Firebase wasn't the tricky part of this
assignment, it was getting it to appear on the actual DOM. Once I actually 
did get it to appear on the DOM, I couldn't figure out how to make the form
reset when info was submitted, and also, how to start a new row for new info
that was submitted.
